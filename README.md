# My_Frame
Final HTML/CSS project for The Odin Project Online Web Development course using my own 12-Column Framework 

I "coded-up" my own version of Confederate Motorcycles (confederate.com) home page. The company's page wasn't 
executed very well so I basically made it more presentable for all screen sizes while maintaining the bare-bones
appearance of the actual page, which I thought looked pretty good.

I used my own 12-column framework for this.

Will be adding javascript in the near future
