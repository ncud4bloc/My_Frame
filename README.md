Odin Project work: Final HTML/CSS project for The Odin Project Online Web Development course using my own 12-Column Framework 

I "coded-up" my own version of Confederate Motorcycles (confederate.com) home page. The company's page wasn't 
executed very well so I basically made it more presentable for all screen sizes while maintaining the bare-bones
appearance of the actual page.  Responsive.
